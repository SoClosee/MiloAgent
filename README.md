## Meet Milo

**Milo** is not a script. He's an AI agent.

He reads Reddit like a human. He understands what people are asking, what tone fits each community, and when your product is genuinely the right answer. He crafts responses that sound like they come from someone who actually uses your product — because his LLM brain has memorized every feature, every FAQ, every competitor difference.

And he learns. Every comment he posts, every upvote or removal he gets back, feeds his learning engine. He figures out which subreddits love him, which keywords work, which tone gets engagement, and which approach gets deleted. Then he adapts.

**Reddit is Milo's home turf.** He knows how subreddits work — the culture, the rules, the anti-self-promotion reflex. He's built to blend in, not stand out. 80% of what he posts is purely organic and helpful. The other 20%? A natural mention of your product, only when it genuinely fits the conversation.

**Twitter/X and Telegram are next.** Milo is actively learning these platforms — scanning conversations, replying to tweets, engaging in Telegram groups. Same brain, new playgrounds. These integrations are functional and improving with every cycle.

### What makes Milo different

| | Traditional bots | **Milo** |
|---|---|---|
| **Content** | Templates + spam | LLM-generated, context-aware, adapted to each community |
| **Strategy** | Fixed rules | Self-learning: adjusts targeting, tone, timing automatically |
| **Detection** | Gets banned fast | Expert personas, human timing, shadowban detection, circuit breakers |
| **Platforms** | Single platform | Reddit expert + Twitter/X & Telegram support |
| **Cost** | API fees | **$0/month** — runs on free-tier LLMs |
| **Intelligence** | None | A/B testing, prompt evolution, sentiment analysis, subreddit intel |

## Reddit — Milo's Expertise

Reddit is where Milo shines. Here's what he can do:

**Conversations** — Scans target subreddits for posts matching your keywords. Reads the post, understands the context, and writes a comment that actually helps while naturally mentioning your product when relevant.

**Personas** — Milo doesn't talk the same way on r/Twitch and r/Entrepreneur. He has 10+ expert personas that adapt his tone, vocabulary, and expertise level to each community.

**Organic presence** — Milo upvotes, subscribes, and participates organically. He builds karma and reputation before ever mentioning your product in a subreddit.

**Seed content** — He creates his own posts: questions, tutorials, comparisons, experience reports. Content that attracts the audience you're targeting.

**Subreddit management** — Milo can create, moderate, and animate your own subreddits. Auto-moderation, sticky posts, weekly content — he runs the community for you.

**Verification** — After posting, Milo checks back: was the comment removed? Did it get upvotes? He penalizes subreddits that delete his content and doubles down on ones that engage.

### How Milo talks

**Organic comment (80%)** — No product mention, just genuine help:
> "I had the same issue — what worked for me was cutting streams into 60-second highlights and posting the best ones. Took some trial and error but now my workflow is pretty smooth. What platform are you targeting first for your clips?"

**Promotional comment (20%)** — Natural mention, only when it fits:
> "I started using [YourProduct] to automate that exact process — the AI picks out the key moments and exports them ready for Shorts/Reels. Saved me a ton of time vs doing it manually. Have you tried any automated clipping tools yet?"

The ratio, tone, and style are all learned and adjusted automatically through A/B testing.

## Twitter/X & Telegram — Learning in Progress

Milo is actively expanding to these platforms with the same intelligence:

### Twitter/X
- Scans tweets and threads matching your keywords
- Replies with context-aware responses
- Posts original tweets and threads
- Likes, retweets, follows strategically
- DM outreach for relationship building
- *Note: Twitter may block server IPs — proxy support included*

### Telegram
- Auto-discovers and joins relevant groups
- Engages in group conversations naturally
- Adapts persona to each group's topic
- Supports Telethon (user account) for authentic presence
- Controlled message frequency to avoid spam detection

Both platforms feed into the same learning engine — Milo gets smarter across all channels simultaneously.

---

## Milo's Brain — Self-Learning System

Milo doesn't just post — he evolves. Four learning systems work in parallel:

### 1. Performance Weighting
Every subreddit, keyword, and content type gets a performance score. High engagement? More attention. Getting deleted? Less activity. Milo automatically shifts his focus to where he's winning.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
When someone replies to Milo, he analyzes the sentiment: "thanks, this helped!" vs "this looks like spam". No LLM calls — fast keyword analysis that adjusts his tone for each subreddit in real-time.

### 3. A/B Testing Engine
Milo runs up to 2 experiments simultaneously, testing:
- **Tone** — casual vs professional vs enthusiastic
- **Post type** — question vs tutorial vs comparison vs experience
- **Length** — short punchy vs detailed long-form
- **Promo ratio** — finding the sweet spot between helpful and promotional

Each experiment runs for a minimum number of samples, then Milo picks the winner and moves on to the next test.

### 4. Prompt Evolution
Milo's most powerful feature: he rewrites his own prompts. By analyzing his top-performing comments, he evolves the LLM templates that generate his content. If a new prompt performs worse (>30% drop), he auto-reverts. Survival of the fittest — for prompts.
