### What is Milo?

Milo is not a script. He's an **autonomous AI agent**.

He reads Reddit like a human — understands what people are asking, adapts his tone to each community, and mentions your product only when it genuinely fits the conversation. He writes his own posts, manages subreddits, builds relationships, and most importantly: **he learns from every outcome** to get better over time.

**Reddit is Milo's expertise.** He understands subreddit culture, anti-promotion reflexes, and community dynamics. 80% of what he posts is purely organic and helpful.

**Twitter/X and Telegram are his expanding skillset.** Same brain, new platforms — these integrations are functional and improving with every learning cycle.

### Highlights

- **Self-learning engine** — A/B tests tone, content type, length, promo ratio
- **Prompt evolution** — Milo rewrites his own LLM prompts based on what performs best
- **10+ expert personas** — adapts personality to each subreddit/community
- **Multi-account rotation** — with independent cooldowns and anti-ban safety
- **3 dashboards** — Web UI, Terminal TUI, Telegram bot
- **Zero cost** — runs entirely on free-tier LLMs (Groq + Gemini)
- **Docker ready** — one-command deployment
