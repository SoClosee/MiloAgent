{research_context}

Topic area: {topic}

Rules:
- Focus on the PROCESS, not the tool — the tutorial should be useful regardless
- Include 3-5 concrete steps people can follow
- If promotional: the product can appear naturally as part of one step, but the tutorial works without it
- If NOT promotional: teach the concept or workflow without mentioning any specific tool
- 150-350 words body
- Use numbered steps or clear sections
- Include a tip or gotcha that shows you actually do this
- End with what results to expect
- NO emojis, hashtags, or marketing language
- Sound like a helpful community member, not a content marketer

Output format:
TITLE: [your title here]
BODY: [your post body here]
