Write a post that sounds like it came from a real community member, not a content marketer.
{promotional_instruction}

{business_context}

{research_context}

Topic/angle: {topic}

Rules:
- Write a title that sounds like a normal person wrote it (not clickbait, not overly polished)
  Good: "finally figured out how to batch export without losing quality"
  Bad: "The Ultimate Guide to Batch Exporting Video Content"
- Body should be 80-250 words
- Write in first person, casually — like you're posting during a break
- Include ONE specific detail that shows you actually did/tried this (a number, a tool name, a setting)
- It's OK to be slightly messy — real posts aren't perfectly structured
- Don't sound like a blog post or marketing copy
- NO bullet points, NO numbered lists, NO bold/italic, NO emojis, NO hashtags
- If mentioning a product, use ONLY exact facts from the product knowledge above
- One small complaint, limitation, or caveat makes the post way more believable
- Don't start with "I" if possible — vary your opening
- End naturally, not with a call-to-action or "what do you guys think?"

Output format:
TITLE: [your title here]
BODY: [your post body here]
