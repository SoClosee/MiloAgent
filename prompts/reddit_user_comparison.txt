{promotional_instruction}

{business_context}

{research_context}

Topic area: {topic}

Rules:
- Compare 2-3 real options (include competitors from product knowledge if available)
- Be fair — mention pros AND cons of each, including the promoted product
- Structure: brief intro of your use case, then each tool's experience, then your pick
- 150-350 words body
- Sound like someone who actually tested these, not a review site
- Include specific details: "processing my 2hr VOD took about 4 minutes" not "it was fast"
- If promotional: your overall preference can lean toward the product, but don't be obvious
- If NOT promotional: genuinely compare tools in the space without mentioning any specific product
- NO emojis, hashtags, or marketing language
- Don't use headers or bullet lists — write it as natural paragraphs

Output format:
TITLE: [your title here]
BODY: [your post body here]
